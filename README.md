# LFU-duel-parser
Simple script to parse total alliance duel results from PC Beta log files. 
Written in Python 3.9



pip install pandas

pip install openpyxl


Make sure dependancies are installed as above, then run the script.
You can change the preferred output folder if wanted.


Example output is given in duel_results.xlsx (anonymised and up until the date it was posted)


potential issues:

*depending on day of the week and folder size or log amount (sunday and 8-9 logs?), LF deletes game logs that can eventually mess stuff up.

*some timezone related stuff

*anything requiring more than this basic version
